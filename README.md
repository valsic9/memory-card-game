# Memory Card game
This Vite project implements an online memory card game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. The game features a grid of face-down cards that the player flips over two at a time to match pairs. The objective is to find all matching pairs with the fewest moves and in the shortest time.

## Key Features:

Game Layout: The game grid is created using HTML and styled with SCSS. Each card is represented by a div element, and the colours of the cards are initially hidden, revealing them only when flipped.
Game Logic: JavaScript controls the flipping of cards, checking for matches, and keeping track of the number of moves made. Cards are shuffled randomly at the start of each game.
State Persistence: The game state, including the positions of cards and flipped cards, is saved using the browser's localStorage. This allows the playerâ€™s progress to be retained even after reloading the page or closing the tab.
Reset Feature: A reset button is provided, allowing players to reset the game, shuffle the cards, and start fresh. This also clears the saved game state in localStorage.
Timer Functionality: The game features an automatic timer that starts as soon as the game begins. The timer runs continuously while the player is trying to match the cards. Once all pairs are found, the timer stops, and the final time is displayed to the player.
Responsive Design: The game is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices.
The game uses:

HTML: To structure the game layout and create the game board.
SCSS: For styling the cards, animations for flipping, and the overall layout of the game. SCSS allows for more dynamic and organized styling with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
JavaScript: To implement the core game logic, handle user interactions (card flips, checking matches), manage the saving/loading of game state via localStorage, and control the timer functionality.
This combination of technologies creates a lightweight, interactive memory card game that saves progress between sessions and provides a fun challenge by tracking the time it takes to find all card pairs.
